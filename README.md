# Group 7's project repositoty

## Project Overview & Description

This project was conducted by an interdisciplinary research team consisting of five students from diverse fields: Media Studies, Linguistics, Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Business Management. Our task was to investigate mainland Chinese users' perceptions of dominant ideologies presented on the Douyin platform.

After a thorough examination of the article and dataset provided, we formulated our primary research question:

Is there a correlation between higher education and negative attitudes towards mainstream ideologies presented in short video content?

Our analysis revealed that some respondents found traditional factors or mainstream ideologies offensive. This sentiment appeared to correlate positively with respondents who had higher educational backgrounds and were from more economically developed regions. Based on these observations, we set the direction of our research to explore correlations between demographic information and attitudes toward mainstream content.

The project aims to provide insights into how demographic factors influence perceptions of state-sponsored narratives and ideologies in China’s rapidly evolving digital landscape.
